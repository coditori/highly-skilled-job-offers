## Introduction
In this book, we aim to provide a comprehensive guide for individuals seeking to work abroad. The process of finding a job in a foreign country can be daunting, but with the right knowledge, resources, and strategies, you can successfully navigate the journey.

### 1.1. Personal journey
My journey into working abroad began with a job at ING Bank in the Netherlands. With a decade of experience in software engineering, I was eager to explore new opportunities in a different country. I started coding in 2005, and the Netherlands offered a unique environment to grow both professionally and personally.

Upon arrival, I had to adapt to cultural differences, new communication styles, and the Dutch language. However, the experience was incredibly rewarding. I realized that success abroad isn't just about experience and I believe that even someone with less experience can achieve similar success if they are equipped with the right knowledge, strategies, and determination. This realization inspired me to write this book, sharing my journey and helping others achieve their dreams of working abroad.
